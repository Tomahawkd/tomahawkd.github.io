# Introduction

## Definitions

- **Information Security**  
  The practice of preventing unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
  modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information.


- **Threat Agent**:  
  An entity who can manifest a threat. 
  It could be internal or external to the organisation or network.
  

- **Threat**:  
  A threat is a potential cause of an incident that may result in harm to 
  a system or organisation (ISO 27002).

  In other words, what can go wrong and how can it hurt the organisation?

  This includes a number of categories, such as rootkits, backdoors, malware, 
  natural disasters, etc.
  

- **Vulnerability**:  
  A vulnerability is a weakness of an asset or a group of assets that can 
  be exploited by one or more threats (ISO 27002). This may be in a procedure, 
  hardware or software.
  
  In other words, a vulnerability tells us why an asset is not protected 
  from a threat.
  

- **Risk**:  
  A risk is the potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities 
  of an asset or a group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organisation 
  (ISO 27002).

  We could also view this as the likelihood of a threat agent taking advantage 
  of a vulnerability and the resultant impact to the organisation’s assets.


- **Impact**:  
  The impact is the result of a risk materialising, caused by a threat, 
  which affects assets (ISO 27005).

  In other words, if the asset is exploited, what is the real cost 
  to the organisation?
  

- **Safeguard**:  
  Also known as risk treatment action, safeguards can be used to mitigate, 
  transfer or remove the threat altogether.

## Risk Management

- **Definition**  
  Coordinated activities to direct and control an organisation with regard to 
  cyber security risks (ISO27005).  
  Risk management ensures that security measures are:  
  - relevant
  - timely
  - responsive to threats
  - cost-effective.

- **Lifecycle and steps**

</div>

1. **Asset Identification**  
  Analysis of the main organisation assets and the value they have for
  the organisation. This is crucial to be able to understand and analyse
  the impact of a risk in an organisation.
  

2. **Threat Assessment**  
    Analysis of which entities could pose a threat to the organisation, so 
    as to understand them better and be able to ascertain what they
    would like from an organisation.
  

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**  
  Testing of the organisation’s systems, policies, procedures and
  physical environment to determine socio-technical and physical
  vulnerabilities that threats could exploit.
  

4. **Risk Assessment**  
  Combination of the three previous analyses to analyse the risks the
  organisation faces.
   

5. **Risk Treatment**  
   A consideration of the best course of action (Reduce, Transfer, Avoid
   or Accept the risk) to mitigate a risk, based on the risk analysis.


6. **Risk Monitoring**  
   A process of continuously updating the previous analyses to identify
   changes in terms of assets, threats, vulnerabilities and resulting
   risks, in order to determine whether the risk treatment needs to
   change.
